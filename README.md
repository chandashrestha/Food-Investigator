Requirement!!
You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation.

This will be a formal presentation. 

One in which you explain in detail:

Your overall applicationâ€™s concept

The motivation for its development

Your design process

The technologies you used (and briefly how they work)

A demonstration of its functionality

Directions for future development

Treat the presentation seriously! 

Talking intelligently about tech > doing tech sometimes.
